The repository contains codes for three deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The algorithms are written in _**python**_ and _**pytorch**_ is used for accessing deep learning libraries.
# Algorithms
1. Deep Q-learning 
2. Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
3. Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG)
